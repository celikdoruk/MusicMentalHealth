A Survey: Music's Relationship with Mental Health

📊 Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between music listening habits and mental health indicators such as anxiety, depression, OCD, and insomnia.
Using survey data, I built a Power BI dashboard to visualize insights and better understand how different genres, listening frequencies, and age groups interact with mental health outcomes.


🛠️ Tools Used
- Power BI for data visualization and dashboard building
- Python (pandas) for dataset preparation and separation
- SQL for data cleaning transformation, and aggregation 


🧠 Project Workflow
Data Preparation:
- Cleaned and separated raw survey data using Python (Pandas).
- Created SQL scripts to structure and refine the dataset further.

    Analysis:
        - Investigated average music listening times by age group.
        - Analyzed mental health scores across different music genres.
         -Explored the effect of rock music listening frequency on anxiety and depression.
        - Measured public sentiment regarding music's impact on mood.
        - Identified favorite music genres among participants.

    Visualization:
        - Built an interactive dashboard in Power BI.
        - Used bar charts, donut charts, gauges, and stacked visuals for clear storytelling.


🔍 Key Insights
- Video Game Music and Jazz listeners reported the highest anxiety and depression scores.
- Listening to Rock music very frequently correlated with slightly lower depression scores compared to rarely or never listening.
- About 74% of participants reported that music improved their mood.
- Rock and Pop were the most popular genres among participants.
