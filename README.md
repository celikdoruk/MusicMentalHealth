A Survey: Music's Relationship with Mental Health
📊 Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between music listening habits and mental health indicators such as anxiety, depression, OCD, and insomnia.
Using survey data, I built a Power BI dashboard to visualize insights and better understand how different genres, listening frequencies, and age groups interact with mental health outcomes.
🛠️ Tools Used

    Power BI for data visualization and dashboard building

    Python (Jupyter Notebook) for dataset preparation and separation

    SQL for data cleaning and transformation

🧠 Project Workflow

    Data Preparation:

        Cleaned and separated raw survey data using Python (Pandas).

        Created SQL scripts to structure and refine the dataset further.

    Analysis:

        Investigated average music listening times by age group.

        Analyzed mental health scores across different music genres.

        Explored the effect of rock music listening frequency on anxiety and depression.

        Measured public sentiment regarding music's impact on mood.

        Identified favorite music genres among participants.

    Visualization:

        Built an interactive dashboard in Power BI.

        Used bar charts, donut charts, gauges, and stacked visuals for clear storytelling.

🔍 Key Insights

    Children listened to music the most daily (~4 hours), while adults listened slightly less (~3.2 hours).

    Video Game Music and Jazz listeners reported the highest anxiety and depression scores.

    Listening to Rock music very frequently correlated with slightly lower depression scores compared to rarely or never listening.

    About 74% of participants reported that music improved their mood.

    Rock and Pop were the most popular genres among participants.

🌟 Final Thoughts

This project allowed me to practice full-cycle data analytics: from raw data to final visualization.
It also highlighted how music can be a powerful tool in supporting mental well-being.
